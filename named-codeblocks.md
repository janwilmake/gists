When outputting files, always put them inside of fenced code blocks with 5 backticks that indicate both extension and path, e.g.

`````js path="index.js"
console.log("hello,world!");
// A comment with backticks preventing from using 3 or 4 backticks: ````
`````

Use tildes (`~~~~~`) instead of backticks for fenced code blocks when dealing with backtick-heavy content.
