I don't like the fact that gists are not also a repo. I think they should be (github feature request!)

Therefore I have decided putting all my gists in this repo, hoping GitHub would later adopt this pattern too, making `gists` a special reponame, just like `{owner}` is a special reponame.

As you can see, since I have always thought this, it has withheld me from creating many gists in the past, but now this repo is gonna grow.
